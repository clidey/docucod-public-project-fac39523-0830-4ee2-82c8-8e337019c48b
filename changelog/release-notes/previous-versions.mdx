## Example Code from the Source Reference

Here is a snippet illustrating the version control constant defined in the client, important for version referencing:

```go
package posthog

import "flag"

// Version of the client.
const Version = "1.6.12"

// getVersion returns the client version, overridden during tests
func getVersion() string {
    if flag.Lookup("test.v") != nil {
        return "1.0.0"
    }
    return Version
}
```

This shows how the version constant is maintained and can be overridden in testing scenarios, reflecting the versioning practices documented here.
